      <p>
        Europa's subsurface ocean is a remarkable feature that has captivated
        scientists and fueled speculation about the potential for life beyond
        Earth. Hidden beneath its icy crust, this vast ocean is believed to
        contain more than
        <strong>twice the amount of water found on Earth</strong>. The ocean is
        kept in a liquid state due to the heat generated by tidal forces from
        Jupiter's gravitational pull and the moon's eccentric orbit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Estimates suggest that Europa's subsurface ocean could be up to 100
        kilometers (60 miles) deep, making it
        <em>one of the largest known bodies of water in the solar system</em>.
        The water is thought to be in contact with a rocky seafloor, creating a
        diverse and potentially habitable environment. The ocean is also likely
        to contain a variety of dissolved salts and minerals, originating from
        the moon's rocky interior.

        <em
          >The existence of a subsurface ocean on Europa has profound
          implications for astrobiology</em
        >.
        <strong
          >The presence of liquid water, along with the availability of energy
          and essential chemical elements, makes Europa a prime candidate for
          hosting life</strong
        >. Scientists speculate that the ocean may be capable of supporting
        microbial life forms, similar to those found in Earth's extreme
        environments such as hydrothermal vents. Future missions aim to study
        the composition and dynamics of Europa's ocean to search for signs of
        life and gain insights into the potential habitability of this
        intriguing moon.
