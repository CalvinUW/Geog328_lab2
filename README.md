This website was by Calvin Standaert as part of assignment two for the University of Washington's summer 2023 class of GEOG328, taught by Professor Bo Zhao. In the website is a wiki page made for the fourth largest Jovian moon: Europa. 

The website notably utilizes several components taken from [W3Schools tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/default.asp), including a slideshow, background image, embedded video, responsive navbar, and scroll-to-top button.
