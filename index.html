        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Europa is one of the fascinating moons of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. It is widely
            recognized for its unique and intriguing characteristics, particularly its icy surface and the potential
            presence of a subsurface ocean. Europa's surface is covered by a layer of ice, which gives it a smooth and
            relatively young appearance compared to other celestial bodies.</p>

        <p>The most captivating aspect of Europa is its subsurface ocean, which is believed to be hidden beneath the icy
            crust. This vast ocean is estimated to contain more than twice the amount of water found on Earth. The
            presence of this liquid water, along with the heat generated by tidal forces from Jupiter's gravity and the
            moon's eccentric orbit, keeps the ocean in a liquid state. Scientists speculate that Europa's subsurface
            ocean may harbor the necessary conditions for life to exist.</p>

        <p>Europa's geology is characterized by a network of fractures, ridges, and evidence of geological activity.
            These features suggest that the moon's icy crust is constantly shifting and changing due to the tidal forces
            exerted by Jupiter and its neighboring moons. Scientists have also observed evidence of cryovolcanism on
            Europa, with eruptions of water and other volatile substances from beneath its surface.</p>

        <p>Due to its potential habitability and the possibility of hosting life, Europa has become a prime target for
            future exploration missions. Space agencies, such as NASA and the European Space Agency, have planned
            missions to study Europa in more detail, aiming to unravel its mysteries, explore its subsurface ocean, and
            search for signs of life. Europa continues to captivate the scientific community as we strive to understand
            the potential for life beyond Earth and the secrets held by this intriguing moon of Jupiter.</p>
